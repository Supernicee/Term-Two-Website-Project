				<p style="font-family:courtier,monaco,helvetica;">Personally I have been playing Minecraft ever since I was around 8 to 9 years old. 
				Whenever I went to  my friend's house I begged him to let me use his Ipad to play Minecraft and watch scary videos of Herobrine. 
				Throughout the years, I have played Minecraft on mobile devices, on the pc, and most recently on console (#xbox gang). After my brother
				and I finally persuaded our parents to buy us the game with an xbox they eventually gave in and bought it for us. Ever since then until 
				maybe two years ago, both my brother and I have been hardcore grinding the game, including beating the Ender Dragon several times. This 
				was probably my one and only favourite childhood game, and now the next generations favourite game. As time goes on however, the game 
				does get pretty boring and pointless to the teen/adult minds, and you transition into more fps, and violent games.</p>
