				<p>Minecraft is a game where there is no particular goal to accomplish, allowing players to choose what they will do with the game.
				Players can mine blocks which may contain precious resources, or just worthless materials. What they plan to do with the resources 
				they acquire is totally up to them, and the list of items that you can make with it is endless. Although you can make  
				mansions, schools, or items, there is a way of completing the game. This consists of gathering eye of enders (which you have to make from getting goods from the nether), finding a dungeon, and eventually 
				teleporting your way into the ender. The ender has the final boss which is called the ender dragon. Once you kill or destroy this dragon, 
				you will have completed the game. You then get teleported back to the real world, everything's back to normal, and you can still do whatever you want to do with the game.</p>
